                        <h2>Flower Lamp</h2>
                        <p>This is one of my works I am most proud of. <br> It was inspired by the view gotten from one of the high buildings in Lagos.</p>

                        <h2>The Human Face</h2>
                        <p>This is one of my favorite abstract works. <br> It is centered around the human face with shrapnel like figures surrounding it. </p>

                        <p>This was one of my first works. <br> The name was chosen because such beauty was captured by this hands.</p>

                        <h2>Unfinshed peace</h2>
                        <p>I got inspired for this artwork when I traveled around africa. <br> I thought it was quite poetic and decided to transform it into an masterpiece.</p>

                        <h2>What We feel</h2>
                        <p>I've always thought the human pain  was quite artistic in itself. <br> It was only a matter of time before I made a project based of it.</p>

                        <p>This is my most recent work. <br> It was inspired by the hardships and difficulties women face as they approach adulthood.</p>
